# Apex Medical Research & Care — High-Fidelity Prototype

Files added:
- index.html
- styles.css
- script.js

Overview:
This is a high-fidelity static prototype demonstrating the requested ultra-modern, clinical aesthetic using an Electric Blue / Frost White / Gunmetal Grey palette. It includes:
- Vertical fixed sidebar (desktop)
- Asymmetrical split hero (60/40) with glassmorphism and a booking engine
- Masonry floating service cards
- Mobile adaptations: bottom navigation, stacked hero, sticky booking block
- Heavy gesture-style swipe for the doctor carousel

Added content:
- Reviews, full Appointment form, Doctors profiles, Infrastructure, About, FAQ, Footer and Contact.
- Animated stats counters and FAQ toggles.

Updates:
- Mobile: the sidebar is hidden on small screens and a fixed bottom navigation is shown.
- The booking panel is fixed above the bottom nav on mobile so it's always visible.
- Swipe gestures use pointer events and snap to cards; resizing recalculates card sizes.

How to run:
Open `index.html` in a browser (no build step required).

Next steps (optional):
- Replace SVG placeholder with a real 3D render or WebGL scene.
- Hook the booking form to a backend API.
- Add a11y labels and keyboard navigation improvements.
